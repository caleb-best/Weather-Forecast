## Introduction ##
This is weather application that gives you the current weather data, as well as a future 5 day forecast.

## Technologies ##
The application uses 3 different Open Weather API's to get the data. One for the Current Day, one for the UV Index, and one to get the five day forecast. This was achieved through the use of Javascript, and HTML with the use of Bootstrap and CSS for some styling.

Extra scripts that were used are moment.js and jQuery. Moment JS was used to format the dates of the applicarion and jQuery was to make DOM access more simplified.
